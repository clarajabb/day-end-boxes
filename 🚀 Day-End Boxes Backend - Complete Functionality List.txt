🧪 Testing Plan - Let's Test Each Feature
Now let's test them one by one! Here's the order I suggest:
Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure
✅ Server Health - Check if server responds
✅ API Documentation - Access Swagger docs
✅ Rate Limiting - Test throttling
Phase 2: Authentication Flow
📱 Send OTP - Test Lebanese phone number validation
🔑 Verify OTP - Test OTP verification and JWT generation
👤 Profile Management - Test JWT-protected endpoints
Phase 3: Business Logic
🏪 Merchants - Test merchant listing
📦 Boxes - Test box discovery
🎫 Reservations - Test reservation system
👑 Admin - Test admin endpoints
Which functionality would you like to test first?
I recommend starting with:
Server Health Check - curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/docs
API Documentation - Open in browser
Send OTP - Test the authentication flow
Let me know which one you'd like to start with! 🚀
